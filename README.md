# AI Salesman Project

## Overview

Welcome to the AI Salesman project! This project focuses on utilizing fine-tuned models, specifically Misters 7B and Lamma 7B, on the [Craigslist_bargains](https://huggingface.co/datasets/craigslist_bargains) dataset from Hugging Face. The objective is to create an AI-powered system capable of generating sales-oriented text based on the input data, including a model well-versed in negotiation.

## Introduction

The AI Salesman project aims to leverage state-of-the-art language models to generate sales-oriented text, with a particular focus on negotiation skills. The core models used in this project are Misters 7B and Lamma 7B, fine-tuned on the Craigslist_bargains dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Craigslist_bargains dataset from Hugging Face. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and use this dataset.

## Model Fine-tuning

The Misters 7B and Lamma 7B models were fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques. The fine-tuning process enhances the models' ability to generate sales-specific text, including effective negotiation strategies, based on the characteristics of the Craigslist_bargains dataset.


## Pre-processing

Before fine-tuning, the dataset underwent a pre-processing phase to ensure compatibility with the chosen models. Tokenization, cleaning, and other relevant pre-processing steps were applied to prepare the data for training.

## Lora and Quantization

The fine-tuned models were further optimized using Lora and quantization methods. These techniques aim to reduce the model size and improve inference speed without compromising performance.

## Results


The AI Salesman project has achieved promising results in generating sales-oriented text, showcasing well-versed negotiation skills. The efficiency of the models is evident in the quality and coherence of the generated content.
